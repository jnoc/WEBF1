      <h3>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Personal information is an important part of society. It is key that this information is in the right hands otherwise, through malicious intent it can be used against users <em><a href="#NCA" title="National Crime Agency">(National Crime
            Agency, n.d.)</a></em>. Cybersecurity is critical
        when
        tackling these threats on the internet. The world is becoming increasingly digitized <em><a href="#IWS" title="Internet World Statistics">(Internet World Stats, 2017)</a></em> leading to an acceleration of data being readily available to
        users. Thus, through mitigation of personal information,
        the
        threat to a user can be reduced. Mitigation is described as making something less harmful <em><a href="#CBU" title="Cambridge University Press">(Cambridge University Press, n.d.)</a></em>, hence preventing the information loss to start with
        is crucial as this will determine how freely the data
        would be
        leaked. Personal information after it has been leaked can be a difficult task for some users to comprehend. This is why there are ways in which a user can overcome this problem through its mitigation.</p>
      <h4>Prevention of personal information loss to begin with</h4>
      <p>By having a system put in place, security problems will not be down to the system itself yet will be down to the awareness of the users, as said by a notorious hacker “it's easier to manipulate people rather than technology” <em><a href="#KMIT"
            title="K Mitnick">(K Mitnick,
            2002)</a></em>. This system would involve the users to participate in testing and educated on how to protect their data all through an online learning system making it straightforward to understand <em><a href="#CRY" title="C Chen, R Shaw, S Yang">(C
            Chen, R Shaw, S Yang, 2006)</a></em>. This
        can be
        implemented either in a company or household to deter users from leaking their company data or own personal data. Mitigation would involve users changing the way they act online, separate email accounts, phones and randomly created passwords
        would aid to their security within the internet. In office hours different levels of clearance would lessen the risk of accidental exposure due to specific personnel who understand the sensitivity of the data.</p>
      <p>Other ways in which users can be cautious is understanding that the growing number of data collectors collect explicit information about anything a user is doing on the browser. Through the failure of security from 3rd party data
        collectors, cookies can be compared and linked to reused emails <em><a href="#BKC" title="B Krishnamurthy, K Naryshkin, C Wills">(B Krishnamurthy, K Naryshkin, C Wills, 2011)</a></em>. Therefore, it is key to understand that user actions can
        lead to vulnerability. Protection from this threat may include
        using a
        virtual private network <em>(VPN)</em> or an anonymous proxy to be routed through to the webpage. This will mask the user's location <em><a href="#MIC" title="Microsoft explains a 'VPN'">(Microsoft, n.d)</a></em>, yet further settings within
        the browser such as clearing your cookies will
        prevent tracking
        <em><a href="#PRI" title="Privacy related to cookies">(Privacy, 2018)</a></em>. More privacy can be achieved by turning on ‘Do not track’ requests as well as installing an HTTPS plugin “that encrypts your communications with many major
        websites” <em><a href="#EFF" title="EFF on HTTPS">(Electronic Frontier Foundation, n.d)</a></em>
        when visiting HTTP
        pages.</p>
      <p>Physical and poor network security may also lead to personal information loss. Through the use of USB or email, users with malicious intent can send files and export files to a physical copy to be handed over to an external user <em><a href="#PGD"
            title="P Gordon">(P Gordon, 2007)</a></em>. To counter this, employers can have the security of the computers digitally and physically secured from these exploits that may be attempted by a user. A virtual desktop infrastructure <em>(VDI)</em>
        can be used to create “a walled garden” <em><a href="#PGD" title="P Gordon">(P Gordon, 2007, pg 36)</a></em> which would prevent the user from removing data via USB. While emails can be dealt with in an equivalent program that would be
        similar to blocking USB attempts.</p>
      <h4>Personal information loss and how can it be made less harmful</h4>
      <p>After data has been leaked it may seem hard to establish how to deal with that data being public. The first assessment of personal information loss is how sensitive is the data and how can it directly affect an individual. Through
        mitigation of personal information, an individual may look into if and how the type of information leaked requires a specific route to tackle the issue. This could involve criminal law, statute law, government regulation or common law <em><a href="#SF" title="S
          Sproule, F Vachon">(S
          Sproule, F Vachon, 2015)</a></em>. When looking into the depth of the personal information that has been leaked some factors should be considered, does the data impact your rights, can you take legal action or how high a risk is this in the
        hands of
        other people? From this, you can take the right action for protecting your leaked personal information.</p>
      <p>Though personal information can be leaked by the user it is also possible that other users in contact with that user may accidentally leak personal data of that user without knowing it. Privacy settings on social media such as Facebook and
        Twitter allow users to hide sensitive and personal information <em><a href="#FCE" title="Facebook">(Facebook, 2018)</a><a href="#TWT" title="Twitter">(Twitter, 2018)</a></em> from the ‘non-friends’ or ‘followers’, this may include a setting to hide pictures. However if another connected user posts a picture or
        birthday
        message for the private user but in the public domain, then that personal information has been leaked unknowingly. From this, it is important to understand how making sure that other users understand about individuals privacy. This can be
        easily removed by reminding that user or reporting it.</p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Mitigating personal information is key in preventing this personal information loss from being leaked in the first place. This is very important when thinking about the ways in which the attacks can occur, such as phishing, social
        engineering, file hijacking, keylogging, eavesdropping, and malware as these types of attacks have “increased almost fourfold between January 2016 and October 2017” <em><a href="#CIS" title="Cisco">(Cisco, n.d.)</a></em>. These can be fought against using some of the
        information
        found in this review, yet it is understandable that there are more ways to counter these attacks. As well as this, it is important to understand how users can approach their leaked information in the appropriate way.</p>
